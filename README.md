ENTERPRISE APPLICATION ENVIRONMENTS COURSEOWRK
  - COBOL INTRO - COBOL program with embedded JCL statements. The JCL statements specify the libraries where the system can find the necessary programs to compile and run the COBOL program.
      The COBOL program itself, SALESRPT, reads input data records and writes them to standard output
  
  - COBOL REPORTS - JCL script used to compile and run a COBOL program on an IBM z/OS mainframe system. The script specifies the COBOL compiler and the necessary libraries to use for the compilation.
      The COBOL program, SALESRPT, creates two reports based on information contained in an input file.
  
  -  ASSEMBLER REPORTS - Job log from IBM z/OS mainframe system. The log contains information about the job's execution, including the user ID associated with the job, the steps executed, the resources used, and the job's return code.

  -  COBOL TABLES AND SUBPROGRAMS -  A COBOL program that processes a sales transaction file and generates two reports. The program reads from an input file, processes each record, and writes output to two report files.
       The program interacts with other programs or subroutines, written in Assembler / COBOL, to perform additional calculations or processing.
